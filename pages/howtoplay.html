        <p>
          You're what is called a Shooter and you're always in place of Rolling the Dice. On your
          first Roll Two win the game, you will need to Roll a 7 or 11. To lose the game on your
          first roll if you roll a 2,3 or 12 then you lose the game. If on your first Roll you roll
          any of the remaining possible numbers like 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 this will be your Pointer.
          The Pointer moves on to another Roll you will need to Roll the same number as your pointer
          to Win the game but if you Roll a 7 then you lose the Game. You will need to keep rolling
          until you either Roll your Pointer Or the 7.
